# DeepTraffic
> Being stuck in traffic is frustrating and expensive. Beyond headaches and missed appointments, traffic congestion costs U.S. drivers some $300 billion annually.

Researchers suggest self-driving cars — even in small numbers — will dramatically improve traffic flow. Lex Fridman and his team at MIT created a game to accelerate this future.

DeepTraffic simulates a typical highway environment, and its players control their own car using deep learning. The simulation makes complex technical concepts accessible for beginners, and the gamification pushes experts to develop completely new techniques. [1]

## Intro

DeepTraffic was originally created for a class Fridman teaches at MIT. It gained popularity when both the course content and the game were opened to the public. With over 12,000 submissions to date, DeepTraffic is competitive.

## Submission:

The attached net.js file contains code for ~70mph speed.
This is not the final submission because there are some remaining modifications, after which I will train the network again.
